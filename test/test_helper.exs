# Pre-download every locale our tests reference so individual
# test cases don't pay a cold-cache locale download per run.
# Without this, the first call into any uncached locale stalls
# for 1-2 seconds while the ETF file streams from the CDN, which
# both inflates the suite's total wallclock and makes any
# "must complete in N ms" assertion (like the regression test
# for the `best_match` recursion fix in date_test.exs) brittle.
#
# Keep this list in sync with the locales referenced anywhere
# under `test/`. Extracted with:
#
#     grep -rhoE 'locale: :"[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z\-]*"' test/ | sort -u
#
# Plus the locales explicitly named in `~D` / `Date.new`
# fixtures for non-Gregorian calendars (e.g. ja-JP for the
# Japanese imperial calendar, ar-SA for Islamic, th-TH for
# Buddhist).
#
# List the *canonical CLDR locale id* for each referenced locale:
# non-CLDR forms canonicalise at load time (en-US -> en,
# pt-BR -> pt, th-TH -> th, zh-TW -> zh-Hant, zh-HK -> zh-Hant-HK),
# and only canonical ids exist as generated ETF files on the CDN.
